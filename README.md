The responsive design tests were carried out manually using [Google Chrome dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/), [Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/), as well as manual testing on various devices.

During validation a few errors were returned for the index.html file, as listed below: 

![Screenshot of html validation error](assets/README-images/error-1.png)
* The h1 heading element was used six times throughout the home page, to fix this error the relevant h1 elements were changed to h2 and the CSS styling was updated to maintain cohesive styling.

![Screenshot of html validation error](assets/README-images/error-2.png)
* An oversight during the process of creating the structure caused a stray div ending tag, this was an easy fix through deletion of the stray tag.

![Screenshot of html validation error](assets/README-images/error-3.png)
* Another oversight during the creation of the structure, a section was left without a closing tag. This was quickly fixed by adding the relevant closing tag. 

#### **Unfixed Bugs**
There are no unfixed bugs within the Up Dog Website.

### **Preformance testing** 
The site was finally tested using [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) which tested for:

The results are shown below:
